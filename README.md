<h3>The history of the Zwilling J.A. Henckels brand</h3>

<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1548" src="https://lunaregina.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Zwilling-J.A.-Henckels-brand.jpg" alt="Zwilling J.A. Henckels brand" width="312" height="269" />The history of the symbol dates back to as far as 1731. Johann Peter Henckels, a local knifemaker, registered the logo as his trademark with the Cutlers´ Guild of Solingen. Also known as &#8220;City of Blades&#8221;, the city is where makers of the world’s finest and most renowned swords, knives, scissors and razors are based.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zwilling&#8221;, meaning &#8220;twin&#8221;, is also the German word for the astrological sign Gemini. The current logo of the brand has been in use since 1969, after several updates from the original.</p>
<p>After nearly 300 years, the Zwilling symbol and name are now recognized all over the world. With solid quality from centuries of experience and innovations in knife making, J. A. Henckels knives are among the best trusted by professional chefs, culinary experts, as well as dedicated home cooks.</p>
<h3>Zwilling J.A. Henckels vs Henckels International: A quick comparison</h3>
<p>Henckels knives come in many lines, but there are all from its two brands: Zwilling J. A. Henckels and J. A. Henckels International.</p>
<p>Zwilling J. A. Henckels is the original brand since 1731. It comes with a Twin logo, and offers high quality knives made in Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>The Henckels International brand, established in 1895, is a separate value brand of ZWILLING J.A. Henckels. This brand provides value conscious customers with quality knives sourced from Spain, China, and Thailand under Henckels standards. Its logo is a single person holding a spear.</p>
<p>All Zwilling knives are made from Henckels special formula steel, and are iced hardened under the Friodur® process for enhanced durability. Henckels International knives, meanwhile, are made of ordinary quality stainless steel and don’t undergo the Friodur®.</p>
<p>As a premium brand, Zwilling knives are usually more expensive than similar ones from the International brand. However, this is not always the case. Each of the brand has several lines, and sometimes knives from one of the International’s high quality lines can be more pricey than those from the “lower” end of Zwilling.</p>
